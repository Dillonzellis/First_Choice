              The credit union is a community-focused organization, owned and
              operated by its 9,000 members. It was founded in 1946 to serve
              employees of Grady Hospital under the name Hospital Authority
              Credit Union. The organization’s name was changed to 1st Choice
              Credit Union in 1991. 1st Choice Credit Union offers a full range
              of financial products and services for individuals and businesses,
              with over 200 Credit Union network locations for Shared Banking
              Services. www.1stchoicecu.org
            </p>
            <p>
              1st Choice was approved as a Community Development Financial
              Institution (CDFI) by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s CDFI
              Fund in January, 2022. The CDFI certification allows qualified
              financial institutions to access grants and other federal funds to
              provide financial products and services in low-income communities
              for local residents and businesses.

            <p>
              Credit Unions are a cooperative with one primary mission: To serve
              their member/owners.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Not for profit.</p>
            <p>
              For-profit corporations who offer a full range of financial
              products and services.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">
              Earnings are returned to members through services like free ATMs,
              better rates and lower fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earnings go to outside bond and stockholders in the form of
              dividends.

            <p class="fw-bold">
              Credit unions are democratically governed and elections are based
              on a one-member, one-vote philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Banks are governed by paid shareholders. Voting rights depend on
              the number of shares owned.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">More than 30,000 surcharge-free ATMs.</p>
            Banks require customers to use their branded ATMs and branches for
            services or pay fees. Some services are unavailable outside the
            bank. Credit unions are local, community based financial
            institutions. Members support their local communities when they bank
            at a credit union. Banks are big! The average size of a bank is
            double that of a credit union. Credit unions have members, not
            shareholders. Banks have customers and shareholders. They must make
            money from their customers to please shareholders.
