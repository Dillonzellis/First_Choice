          <p class="">
            One of the greatest challenges facing Americans today is ensuring
            the financial well being and security of your family throughout
            your retirement years. With uncertainty over the adequacy of
            social security growing daily, it’s increasingly necessary to rely
            on your own savings plans and resources to support your future
            retirement plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet another challenge is finding additional money for the
            impending college education expenses for your children. Tuition
            and other collegiate expenses are on the rise, so it’s a good idea
            to get a head start on saving for those expenses now, instead of
            getting caught unprepared later!

              The money you contribute to a Roth IRA has already been taxed.
              So the principal amount is never subject to taxes or penalties
              in the future, as long as you stay within the contribution
              guidelines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Roth IRAs enable the money you contribute to grow tax-deferred.
              If you do not withdraw any of the earnings until you have had
              the IRA for at least 5 years and have a qualifying event, those
              earnings become tax-free.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no 70½ year age limit on making contributions. You do,
              however, need earned income, which is defined the same as for
              Traditional IRAs. As long as you satisfy the Roth IRA
              requirements, you may contribute to a Roth IRA, even after the
              year in which you reach 70½ years.
