                        <span>1st</span> Choice Credit Union Home Equity Loan is considered a traditional second
                        mortgage and is desirable if you need a one-time specific amount of money. It's a great option
                        for homeowners who have enough equity established in their home to tap into for expenses such as
                        home improvements, bill consolidation or even to purchase new furniture.

            <p>A Fixed-Rate Home Equity Loan is a second mortgage with a fixed rate, which means that your monthly
                payments will not change over the life of the loan. As opposed to a Home Equity Line of Credit, a Home
                Equity Loan will give you a one-time sum which is paid out at closing.</p>
